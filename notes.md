# Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform Workflow notes

I installed the azure cli, and in order for Terraform to work properly, I need to enable Terraform to use my azure account. 

Also, I need to check the latest version of kubernetes available when starting a new cluster. Use the latest stable version.

on 8/16/2022, the latest stable version of kubernetes was: 1.23.8.
